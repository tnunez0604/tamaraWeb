        <h2>A homeless guy is on the streets. He's gone days without eating, and will die if he doesn't eat something before the day ends. He spots a piece of bread on the floor that's all molded.</h2>
        <p>It's time for you to determine his fate. Will he eat it or starve? It's up to you to decide</p>
